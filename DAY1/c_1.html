      /*Coding Challenge #1
      Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
      BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).
      Your tasks:
      1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
      2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
      3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
      Test data:
      ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95m tall.
      ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76m tall.

      // Data Set 1
      let markMass = 78;
      let markHeight = 1.69;
      let johnMass = 92;
      let johnHeight = 1.95;

      let markBMI = markMass / markHeight ** 2;
      let johnBMI = johnMass / johnHeight ** 2;
      let markHigherBMI = markBMI > johnBMI;

      console.log("Mark's BMI:", markBMI.toFixed(2));
      console.log("John's BMI:", johnBMI.toFixed(2));
      console.log("Does Mark have a higher BMI than John?", markHigherBMI);

      // Data Set 2
      markMass = 95;
      markHeight = 1.88;
      johnMass = 85;
      johnHeight = 1.76;

      markBMI = markMass / markHeight ** 2;
      johnBMI = johnMass / johnHeight ** 2;
      markHigherBMI = markBMI > johnBMI;

      console.log("Mark's BMI:", markBMI.toFixed(2));
      console.log("John's BMI:", johnBMI.toFixed(2));
